# GWAS-using-R
The genetic association in children behavior based on Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) scores
The primary goal of this project is to identify genes that are correlated with the behavioural changes in children using a list of candidates (genes already reported to be correlated from earlier studies of these and related traits). Identification of the early environmental exposures and genetic determinants will help in a better understanding of these complex traits which will ultimately lead to better prevention, diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. 
**Methods**
- Selection of candidate genes from published literature
- Quality control
- Enviroment analysis using screen time exposure to determine the interaction with genetic variants
